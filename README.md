  1. 2 types of stablecoins
    - pegged stable coins have their value tied to another assets ( like usd )
    - floating stablecoins use math and other mechanism to maintain a constant buying power 
 2. stability methods
    - algorithmic
    - governed method ( minting and burning determined by governance )
 3. collateral types
    - endogenous => a collateral that originates from inside the protocol ( like TUSD ( terra usd ) uses a luna as a collateral which in the same protocol ), if TUSD fails the LUNA also will fail

    - exogenous => a collateral that originates from outside of a protocol ( like USDT uses usd as a collateral, which is from outside of the protocol ), if USDT fails then USD will not fail. bcoz its from outside of USDT protocol.

 ## Example
   - USDT, USDC price pegged to USD ( harga USDT, USDC ter patok ke harga USD dollar )

### Advanced Testing
 - Fuzz/stateless is a property based testing, a testing that intend to break/exploit our system/app, basically this is a test on how a hacker can break into our system, foundry will try to pass a random data ( integers, strings or other types ) into arguments
   1. stateless fuzzing = where the state of previous run is discarded for every new run
   2. statefull fuzzing = where the final state of previous run is the starting state of the next run;
 - Invariant/stateful test is passing a random data and calling random functions
 - invariant is property that our system/app should always hold
